How to create a virtual machine on VirtualBox:
**
1.
	Go to your windows start menu  Programs and click on “Oracle VM Virtualbox” to start the VirtualBox.** 

2.**	Click on the New button to start a creation of a new virtual machine, “Create virtual machine” wizard will appear, insert the name of your virtual machine, we will use “Ubuntu” as we are going to install the Ubuntu server here. Then select type which is Linux. Version is Ubuntu and click Next. **
 
At this step VirtualBox will guess that how much ram should be allocated for virtual machine. 512 MB is recommended, If you are using 2Gb of ram, go for 512MB but if you have 4GB ram then you can choose 1GB. If you don’t know the ram of your PC go with the default settings and click Next to proceed to next step. 
 
Select “Create a virtual hard drive now” and click Create.
 
Select “VDI (Virtual Box Disk Image)” and click Next. 
 
Next step is about the storage allocation of our virtual disk, there are two option available, one is “dynamically allocated” and second is “fixed size”, so we will choose fixed size storage because it’s faster to use. Click Next. 
 
In this step we can can set the virtual file location and size. Normally Ubuntu’s installation takes approximately 3 GB, we will go with the default 8 GB of disk size. Click Create to proceed to next step. Creation of virtual drive may take 4 to 5 minutes depending upon the size and speed of your PC.  
 
So, we can see the process of our virtual drive creation.  
 
After few minutes your virtual drive will be created and you can check your drives on the left penal of Virtual Box under the New button (we used to create to a new drive).
